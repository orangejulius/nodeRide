# NodeRide

A small personal project created mainly for me to learn node.js and javascript

You can upload Garmin ride files in .tcx format and view the resulting ride with any heartrate/power info superimposed onto Google Maps

There's a live demo running on Heroku at [http://noderide.juliansimioni.com](http://noderide.juliansimioni.com)
